# Compiler
This repository contains phases to build a small compiler for mini-C language
## Phase 1 
In this phase of this
project,a program that tokenizes a stream of characters and
outputs tokens in the order they appeared in the stream of characters.

## Phase 2
a Parser class that implements MiniC grammar using
Recursive descent parser.
- A node root, which is the root of the constructed parse tree.
- A constructor.
- A parse function that calls the start rule in the grammar.
- Each grammar rule has a function.
- This function return its suitable node data type from parse tree.
